# NBA Season Tracker

Welcome to the NBA Season Tracker, a Flask-based web application designed to showcase my web development and data analysis skills. This application provides real-time information and statistics for NBA teams, leveraging Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and integrating with NBA-related APIs.

## About This Project

Inspired by my love of basketball, this project allows basketball fans to quickly retrieve team statistics, see their team ranked by point differential, and play around with weights for team stats and produce a table of rankings based on the user input. The NBA Season Tracker is currently being hosted on Heroku and is actively accessible and updated.

## Features

- **Team Information:** Detailed statistics and insights for every NBA team, showcasing data fetching and processing capabilities.
- **Playoff Status:** Real-time analysis of teams' playoff prospects, demonstrating complex logic implementation.
- **Next Game Schedule:** Integration with external APIs to display upcoming games, highlighting API usage and data presentation.
- **Team Rankings:** Dynamic rankings based on live data, emphasizing backend to frontend data flow.
- **Simulate Playoffs:** A custom-built simulation feature to provide weighted championship predictions.

## Tech Stack
