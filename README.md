# NBA Season Tracker

Welcome to the NBA Season Tracker, a Flask-based web application designed to provide real-time information and statistics for NBA teams.

## About This Project

Inspired by my love for basketball, this project allows fans to quickly retrieve team statistics, see their team ranked by point differential, see which teams score the highest based on weighted categories provided by the user. The NBA Season Tracker is currently being hosted on Heroku and is actively accessible and updated.

- **Playoff Status:** Real-time analysis of teams' playoff prospects.
- **Next Game Schedule:** Integration with external APIs to display upcoming games.
- **Team Rankings:** Dynamic rankings based on live data.
- **Simulate Playoffs:** A custom-built simulation feature to provide weighted championship predictions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap) for responsive design and user interface.
- **Backend:** Flask, Python for server-side logic, API integration, and routing.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for actively storing and managing data (updated hourly).
- **Deployment:** Heroku for cloud deployment with continuous integration, automated testing, task scheduling, and hosting the web application.
